# Conditional Statements

## If Statement

An `if` statement is a conditional statement that runs or skips code based on whether a condition is true or false. Here's a simple example.

```
if phone_balance < 5:
    phone_balance += 10
    bank_balance -= 10
```

Let's break this down.

1. An `if` statement starts with the `if` keyword, followed by the condition to be checked, in this case `phone_balance` < 5, and then a colon. The condition is specified in a boolean expression that evaluates to either True or False.

2. After this line is an indented block of code to be executed if that condition is true. Here, the lines that increment `phone_balance` and decrement `bank_balance` only execute if it is true that `phone_balance` is less than 5. If not, the code in this `if` block is simply skipped.

## Use Comparison Operators in Conditional Statements

You have learned about Python's comparison operators (e.g. `==` and `!=)` and how they are different from assignment operators (e.g. `=).` In conditional statements, you want to use comparison operators. For example, you'd want to use `if x == 5` rather than `if x = 5`. If your conditional statement is causing a syntax error or doing something unexpected, check whether you have written == or =!

## If, Elif, Else

In addition to the `if` clause, there are two other optional clauses often used with an if statement. For example:

```
if season == 'spring':
    print('plant the garden!')
elif season == 'summer':
    print('water the garden!')
elif season == 'fall':
    print('harvest the garden!')
elif season == 'winter':
    print('stay indoors!')
else:
    print('unrecognized season')
```

1. `if`: An `if` statement must always start with an `if` clause, which contains the first condition that is checked. If this evaluates to True, Python runs the code indented in this `if` block and then skips to the rest of the code after the `if` statement.

2. `elif`: `elif` is short for "else if." An `elif` clause is used to check for an additional condition if the conditions in the previous clauses in the `if` statement evaluate to False. As you can see in the example, you can have multiple `elif` blocks to handle different situations.

3. `else`: Last is the `else` clause, which must come at the end of an `if` statement if used. This clause doesn't require a condition. The code in an `else` block is run if all conditions above that in the `if` statement evaluate to False.

## Indentation

Some other languages use braces to show where blocks of code begin and end. In Python we use indentation to enclose blocks of code. For example, if statements use indentation to tell Python what code is inside and outside of different clauses.

In Python, indents conventionally come in multiples of four spaces. Be strict about following this convention, because changing the indentation can completely change the meaning of the code. If you are working on a team of Python programmers, it's important that everyone follows the same indentation convention!

Spaces or Tabs?
The [Python Style Guide](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/#tabs-or-spaces) recommends using 4 spaces to indent, rather than using a tab. Whichever you use, be aware that "Python 3 disallows mixing the use of tabs and spaces for indentation."
