# Arithmetic operators

- \+ Addition
- \- Subtraction
- \* Multiplication
- / Division
- % Mod (the remainder after dividing)
- \*\* Exponentiation (note that `^` does not do this operation, as you might have seen in other languages)
- // Divides and rounds down to the nearest integer

The usual order of mathematical operations holds in Python, which you can review in this Math Forum page if needed.

**Bitwise operators** are special operators in Python that you can learn more about here if you'd like.

Examples

```
print(3 + 5) # 8
print(1 + 2 + 3 * 3) # 12
print(3 ** 2) # 9
print(9 % 2) # 1
```
