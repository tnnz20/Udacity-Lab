# Dictionaries and Identity Operators

## Dictionaries

A **dictionary** is a mutable data type that stores mappings of unique keys to values. Here's a dictionary that stores elements and their atomic numbers.

```
elements = {"hydrogen": 1, "helium": 2, "carbon": 6}
```

Dictionaries can have keys of any immutable type, like integers or tuples, not just strings. It's not even necessary for every key to have the same type! We can look up values or insert new values in the dictionary using square brackets that enclose the key.

```
print(elements["helium"])  # print the value mapped to "helium"
elements["lithium"] = 3  # insert "lithium" with a value of 3 into the dictionary
```

> Output

```
2
{'hydrogen': 1, 'helium': 2, 'carbon': 6, 'lithium': 3}
```

We can check whether a value is in a dictionary the same way we check whether a value is `in` a list or set with the in keyword. Dicts have a related method that's also useful, `get`. get looks up values in a dictionary, but unlike square brackets, get returns None (or a default value of your choice) if the key isn't found.

```
print("carbon" in elements)
print(elements.get("dilithium"))
```

> Output

```
True
None
```

Carbon is in the dictionary, so True is printed. Dilithium isnâ€™t in our dictionary so None is returned by `get` and then printed. If you expect lookups to sometimes fail, `get` might be a better tool than normal square bracket lookups because errors can crash your program.

## Identity Operators

| **Keyword** | **Operator**                                      |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| is          | evaluates if both sides have the same identity    |
| is not      | evaluates if both sides have different identities |

You can check if a key returned None with the `is` operator. You can check for the opposite using `is not`.

```
n = elements.get("dilithium")
print(n is None)
print(n is not None)
```

> Output

```
True
False
```

## When to use Dictionaries?

Let's revisit our Wall Street example from before. Previously we created a list for the index fund, [Vanguard Institutional Index Fund](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/fund/vinix/holdings), because we wanted to print the names of the holdings (or stocks) in the index fund.

Now, let's say as the investment fund manager for VINIX, you also want to print a few more details for each holding. For e.g., what is your rate of return on each of the holdings?

A dictionary will work well here as there is a key: value association. In other words, there is a linkage between each holding and the information (e.g., rate of return), and it can be organized under one index fund, VINIX.

```
VINIX =  {'C': 0.74, 'MA': 0.78, 'BA': 0.79, 'PG': 0.85, 'CSCO': 0.88, 'VZ': 0.9, 'PFE': 0.92, 'HD': 0.97, 'INTC': 1.0, 'T': 1.01, 'V': 1.02, 'UNH': 1.02, 'WFC': 1.05, 'CVX': 1.05, 'BAC': 1.15, 'JNJ': 1.41, 'GOOGL': 1.46, 'GOOG': 1.47, 'BRK.B': 1.5, 'XOM': 1.52, 'JPM': 1.53, 'FB': 2.02, 'AMZN': 2.96, 'MSFT': 3.28, 'AAPL': 3.94}
```

You can add even other details, such as rate of return YTD. For that we can add the details into the value associated with the key, i.e., the ticker symbol for the holding.
Like this:

```
VINIX = {'C': [0.74, -6.51],  'MA': [0.78, 34.77],  'BA': [0.79, 17.01],  'PG': [0.85, -8.81],  'CSCO': [0.88, 18.56],  'VZ': [0.9, 2.16],  'PFE': [0.92, 13.96],  'HD': [0.97, 3.2],  'INTC': [1.0, 2.61],  'T': [1.01, -15.19],  'V': [1.02, 24.0],  'UNH': [1.02, 19.32],  'WFC': [1.05, -3.59],  'CVX': [1.05, -5.77],  'BAC': [1.15, 4.27],  'JNJ': [1.41, -5.58],  'GOOGL': [1.46, 17.84],  'GOOG': [1.47, 17.03],  'BRK.B': [1.5, 4.54],  'XOM': [1.52, -6.87],  'JPM': [1.53, 7.66],  'FB': [2.02, 0.91], 'AMZN': [2.96, 62.75], 'MSFT': [3.28, 26.61], 'AAPL': [3.94, 26.01]}
```

As you can see, data structures are very useful in collecting, storing and working with more information than simple strings or integers.

> Note:

if you define a variable with an empty set of curly braces like this: `a = {}`, Python will assign an empty **dictionary** to that variable. You can always use `set()` and `dict()` to define empty sets and dictionaries as well.
